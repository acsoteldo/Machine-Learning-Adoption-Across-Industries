## Getting Started: 
1. Report and presentation
2. data/: Contains cleaned datasets used for the analysis
3. notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks
4. visualizations/: Tableau visualizations and dashboard
5. scripts/: Python and SQL scripts for data analysis

### Tools:
Excel, Jupyter, Python, SQL, Tableau

### Data Sources:
This dataset includes the options that a diverse group of users on the Google form decided on. 20 questions were on the google form. Most questions revolve around various aspects of programming, including languages, platforms, and experience (see _data/_ for questions).

* Company_Size
* Number_of_Data_Science_Workload_Handlers
* Employers_Adoption_of_ML
* Annual_Compensation_USD
* Total_Expenditure_on_ML_and_Cloud_Services_Past_5_Years_USD
* Best_Developer_Experience_among_Cloud_Platforms
* Most_Used_Big_Data_Product
* Primary_Business_Intelligence_Tool
* Primary_Data_Analysis_Tool_Used_at_Work_or_School

## Problem Definition
In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has become increasingly prevalent across various industries. From healthcare and finance to manufacturing and retail, organizations are leveraging ML to gain insights, optimize processes, and drive innovation. However, the extent and pace of ML adoption vary significantly among different sectors.

### Relevance:
Understanding the factors influencing ML adoption within specific industries is crucial for several reasons:
* Businesses need insights into which industries are leading in ML adoption and the factors driving this trend to make informed strategic decisions regarding investments and resource allocation.
* Identifying industries with high ML adoption rates can help guide individuals aspiring to enter the field of data science and ML towards sectors with greater opportunities for employment and career growth.
* Policymakers and regulatory bodies may use insights into industry-specific ML adoption trends to develop targeted policies and regulations that foster innovation while addressing potential ethical and privacy concerns.
* Understanding the industries that are lagging behind in ML adoption presents opportunities for technology providers and service vendors to tailor their offerings and support initiatives aimed at accelerating adoption within these sectors.

## Hypothesis
The level of data science and machine learning talent within an organization positively correlates with the adoption of ML technologies.

## Vision
To become a source of insights and knowledge on industry-specific machine learning adoption trends, empowering businesses, policymakers, and individuals to make informed decisions, drive innovation, and foster the widespread adoption of machine learning technologies across diverse sectors.

## Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the adoption patterns of machine learning technologies across various industries and their implications for these sectors. By analyzing the available dataset and exploring the drivers and trends of ML adoption, this report aims to address the following objectives:
* Visualize the adoption rates of ML technologies across various industries to highlight sectors that are leading in implementation and innovation.
* Examine how company size within different industries affects the rate of ML adoption, providing insights into whether larger organizations are more inclined to integrate ML technologies.
* Evaluate how years of ML experience among employees within different industries correlate with the adoption of ML technologies, emphasizing the importance of skilled talent in driving ML initiatives.

## Key Insights
* The majority of respondents are male, aged 18 to 29.
* More programming experience correlates with greater ML experience across all age groups.
* Industries with higher average years of ML experience and higher educational qualifications show higher levels of ML adoption, highlighting the importance of experienced talent.
* Computers/Technology and Accounting/Finance lead in both ML adoption and experience, influenced by the majority of respondents working in the CS sector.
* Hospitality/Entertainment and Academics/Education have high average ML experience but lower adoption rates, indicating potential for leveraging experienced talent.
* Larger data science teams are more likely to have well-established ML methods, while smaller teams are typically in the exploration phase of ML.
