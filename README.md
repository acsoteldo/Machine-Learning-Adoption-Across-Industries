Analyzing Factors and Impact Across Sectors

## Getting Started: 
1. Report and presentation
2. data/: Contains cleaned datasets used for the analysis
3. notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks
4. visualizations/: Tableau visualizations and dashboard
5. scripts/: Python and SQL scripts for data analysis

### Tools:
Excel, Jupyter, Python, SQL, Tableau

### Data Sources:
This dataset includes the options that a diverse group of users on the Google form decided on. 20 questions were on the google form. Most questions revolve around various aspects of programming, including languages, platforms, and experience.

The analysis will be based on the cleaned dataset, which includes the following fields:

## Problem Definition
In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has become increasingly prevalent across various industries. From healthcare and finance to manufacturing and retail, organizations are leveraging ML to gain insights, optimize processes, and drive innovation. However, the extent and pace of ML adoption vary significantly among different sectors.

### Relevance:
Understanding the factors influencing ML adoption within specific industries is crucial for several reasons:
* Businesses need insights into which industries are leading in ML adoption and the factors driving this trend to make informed strategic decisions regarding investments and resource allocation.
* Identifying industries with high ML adoption rates can help guide individuals aspiring to enter the field of data science and ML towards sectors with greater opportunities for employment and career growth.
* Policymakers and regulatory bodies may use insights into industry-specific ML adoption trends to develop targeted policies and regulations that foster innovation while addressing potential ethical and privacy concerns.
* Understanding the industries that are lagging behind in ML adoption presents opportunities for technology providers and service vendors to tailor their offerings and support initiatives aimed at accelerating adoption within these sectors.

## Hypothesis
The level of data science and machine learning talent within an organization positively correlates with the adoption of ML technologies.

## Vision
To become a source of insights and knowledge on industry-specific machine learning adoption trends, empowering businesses, policymakers, and individuals to make informed decisions, drive innovation, and foster the widespread adoption of machine learning technologies across diverse sectors.

## Objective
